## ✨ Hello World

Moonworks is building proprietary **Sovereign AI** at the deep-tech layer, advancing all three core wings of AI: **text, speech, and vision**.

At the core, we’ve developed a paradigm-shifting pretraining method, **CAT (Composite Active Transfer)**, that **cuts compute** while enabling unprecedented agility across new languages and domains.

We pioneer Sovereign AI so nations and enterprises can own, govern, and scale their AI—preserving data sovereignty and cultural identity while unlocking innovation.

**Our mission**
- Deliver secure, adaptable **omnimodal AI** tailored to local & cultural context.
- Make AI **accessible and cost-efficient** via proprietary models and infrastructure.

## 🐈‍⬛ CAT (Composite Active Transfer)

> **TL;DR**: CAT builds a **latent-space bridge** between *understanding* and *generation*, letting models acquire new languages/domains quickly and cheaply.

### The Problem
Most non-giant LLMs excel in English and a few high-resource languages (e.g., Chinese, French) but **struggle elsewhere**. Standard fine-tuning can’t invent foundational knowledge of a new language, and continual pretraining often forgets previous skills or demands starting over.

### The radically new CAT Approach
- **Composite objectives** that actively balance understanding ↔ generation.
- **Understanding-first curriculum** that bootstraps into generation.

> _Historical note:_ Natural-language understanding has required far less compute than generation (e.g., masked-LM era). CAT leverages that gap to accelerate generative capabilities.

<details>
<summary><b>Key Properties</b></summary>

- **Latent Bridge** — Aligns NLU representations with generative heads.
- **Language Agility** — Designed to leap the “language learning barrier.”
- **Domain Portability** — From general → specialized corpora with minimal cost.
