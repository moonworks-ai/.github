## Hello World! 👋
Moonworks is building proprietary Sovereign AI at the deep‑tech layer and advancing all three core wings of AI: text, speech, and vision. 

At the core, we have developed a paradigm-shifting CAT pretraining method that cuts compute costs (<1% of current method) with unprecedented agility.

We pioneer Sovereign AI so nations and enterprises can own, govern, and scale their AI, preserving data sovereignty and cultural identity while unlocking innovation. 
Our mission is to:

Deliver secure, adaptable omnimodal AI (text, speech, vision) tailored to local & cultural context.
Make AI accessible and cost‑efficient via proprietary models and infrastructure

### MoonAI: The Moonworks model family for language, vision, and speech.

Captures the soul of art respectfully and accurately with cultural depth.
#### MoonWave (Audio)
Turns simple audio into expressive, powerful sound—even on minimal infrastructure.
#### Selenix (Text)
Bridges cultures to turn every message into a meaningful connection.
